## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ Bootstrap ] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Code meet itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
